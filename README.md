# 2048-Remake-CPP
###### This is a recreation of the game 2048, but in c++. 
###### I used my own library that I created called ChickeLib. I used chickenlib for things such as printing numbers with color, and changing the size of the text of the screen. 
###### I am still yet to add a scoring system to it, but that will come in the near future (hopefully).
###### If you want to compile this for yourself, you will need to have chickenlib.h in the same directory as your code.
